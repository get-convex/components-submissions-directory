# Admin Dashboard Overview

The admin dashboard at `/components/submissions/admin` provides full control over the Components Directory. Access requires a @convex.dev email address.

## Accessing the dashboard

1. Sign in with your @convex.dev email
2. Navigate to `/components/submissions/admin`
3. Or click "Admin" in the header (visible only to admins)

Non-admin users are automatically redirected to their profile page. Unauthenticated users see a simple "Admin access only" sign-in prompt.

## Dashboard layout
