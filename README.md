## What are Convex Components

Convex Components are self-contained TypeScript modules that add backend functionality to Convex app. Think of them as npm packages for your backend: authentication, file storage, rate limiting, analytics, or any reusable pattern you find yourself rebuilding across projects.

Components have their own tables, functions, and scheduled jobs. They install with npm and wire into your existing Convex app without touching your schema.

## The Challenge

See the list of **[components challenges and rewards here.](https://github.com/orgs/get-convex/projects/1/views/1)**

We're looking for developers to build and submit components.

Each challenge focuses on a specific use case or pattern in the following categories:

- Auth / Identity
- AI / Agent Infrastructure
- Analytics
- API Usage
- Content Management
- Full-Stack Drop-In Features
- Storage
- Third-Party Sync

## Component Requirements

A valid Convex Component needs:

- A `convex.config.ts` that defines the component
- Exported functions that other apps can call
- Published to npm with the right entry points
- Documentation showing how to install and use it

The [authoring guide](https://docs.convex.dev/components/authoring) covers the full specification.
